                <h1>JOEL MILLER</h1>
                <p>Joel Miller is the playable protagonist of The Last of Us,
                    and a supporting character in The Last of Us: Left Behind
                    and The Last of Us Part II, in which he is briefly playable.
                    <br><br>
                    Joel was a survivor in post-apocalyptic America that had
                    been ravaged by the Cordyceps brain infection. After
                    losing his only daughter Sarah in the early stages of the
                    outbreak, Joel became a ruthless and cynical smuggler
                    eventually tasked with smuggling and protecting Ellie Williams,
                    a young girl who was the key to mankind's survival.
                    Joel eventually formed a strong bond with her.</p>

                <h1>ELLIE WILLIAMS</h1>
                <p>Ellie grew up as an orphan in the Boston quarantine zone and
                    attended a military preparatory school, where she met and
                    befriended Riley Abel. When Ellie was fourteen, the pair
                    were both infected with the Cordyceps brain infection, where
                    Ellie discovered she was immune. A friend of her mother's
                    and the leader of the Fireflies, Marlene, believed that she
                    was the key to reverse engineering a vaccine. Marlene tasked
                    Joel Miller, a smuggler, with escorting Ellie outside of the
                    QZ. The simple drop-off turned into a year-long journey
                    across America, and the two eventually formed a close bond.</p>

                    A caring and compassionate man, Tommy survived the early
                    years of the outbreak with Joel. However, the two separated
                    as Tommy sought a more meaningful life than mere survival,
                    leading him to join the Fireflies and later seek redemption
                    through his wife, Maria, and the community of Jackson.</p>
